hey, i’m tanvir.

dropped out at 15 because i couldn’t wait to build stuff.

started out sketching sites on paper, then got into figma and turning ideas into code.

worked at [starryai](https://starryai.com/), [vocode](https://vocode.dev), [pikzels](https://pikzels.ai/), [dimensions](https://dimensions.dev), and a bunch more.

right now, i’m building [inspicado](https://inspicado.com) and picking up new skills along the way.

i like sharing what i learn and giving back - community’s always been a big part of it for me.

wanna connect? i’m on [twitter](https://twitter.com/okaytanvir) / [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taseen-tanvir/) / [bento](https://bento.me/okaytanvir)

let’s make something cool together ;)
